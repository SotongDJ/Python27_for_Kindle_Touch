Python Binary for Kindle Touch

This was compiled by someone from official source (I dont sure who did this). 
I got it from [Python for kindle] (http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=153930). 


This branch DON'T need to run "source /mnt/us/python/pythonenv". 
You can just use it directly by excute the file "/mnt/us/python/bin/python" (This "excutable file"/"script file" include the Variable from pythonenv). 
I want to keep the [Python for Kindle 3] (https://github.com/SotongDJ/python-bin-for-kindle-3) downward compatibility, so I don't just setting the python excutable file as "/mnt/us/python/python"


Install Method
============================
* Download the whole "python" folder by click "Download this repo as a zip file"(The Cloud with "ZIP" Word) or click [HERE] (https://github.com/SotongDJ/python-bin-for-kindle-3/zipball/master)
* unzip the zip file and move "python" folder to the root of your Kindle touch which in USB Flash Drive mode (/mnt/us).
